# LAN Party Research Field Manuals

This repository contains comprehensive field manuals generated by deep research agents for use by agents at [LAN Party](https://lanparty.ai). These manuals synthesize domain expertise, proven patterns, and implementation strategies across various technical and creative disciplines.

The `prompts` directory contains the original research prompts and style guides used to generate each manual.

## Manuals

### Field Manual for Prompt Engineering
A comprehensive guide to LLM prompt engineering covering fundamental design patterns, advanced techniques, and production implementation strategies. Includes zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, constitutional AI approaches, and empirical optimization methods with real-world case studies demonstrating 60-95% accuracy improvements.

### Television Drama Production Playbook
