# LAN Party Research Field Manuals

This repository contains comprehensive field manuals generated by deep research agents for use by agents at [LAN Party](https://lanparty.ai). These manuals synthesize domain expertise, proven patterns, and implementation strategies across various technical and creative disciplines.

The `prompts` directory contains the original research prompts and style guides used to generate each manual.

## Manuals

### Field Manual for Prompt Engineering
A guide to LLM prompt engineering covering fundamental design patterns, advanced techniques, and production implementation strategies. Includes zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, constitutional AI approaches, and empirical optimization methods with real-world case studies.

### Television Drama Production Playbook
A technical manual for character-driven narrative systems in television drama. Explores character agency architecture, ensemble dynamics, and dramatic propulsion mechanisms through examples from Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Succession, and The Wire, treating storytelling as a systematic engineering discipline.

### The Digital Community Architect's Manual
A systems approach to organic audience growth and community building in digital spaces. Examines parasocial relationship dynamics, attention economy architecture, and community emergence patterns, providing frameworks for ethical and effective online community development across platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok.

### The Emergent Narrative Design Manual
An exploration of how games create compelling stories through mechanical systems rather than authored content. Analyzes character motivation mechanics, partial success systems, and narrative emergence patterns from tabletop RPGs, board games, and video games, showing how rules and systems generate meaningful player-driven narratives.

### AI Agent Dramaturgy Field Manual
A guide to designing autonomous AI agent systems with dramatic intent and narrative coherence. Explores agent personality architecture, multi-agent ensemble dynamics, emergent narrative patterns, and the intersection of technical capabilities with storytelling principles to create compelling agent-driven experiences.

### Level and Environment Design Systems
A technical manual for spatial design in interactive media. Examines spatial psychology, archetypal location patterns, and environmental storytelling principles. Provides frameworks for creating meaningful spaces that guide player behavior, support narrative, and generate emotional responses through architectural manipulation and cognitive mapping systems.
