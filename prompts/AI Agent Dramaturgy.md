# Deep Research: The AI Agent Dramaturgy Manual

## Research Objective
Create a comprehensive field manual for designing autonomous AI agents as dramatic performers in interactive entertainment systems. Focus on engineering agent personalities, motivations, and behaviors that generate compelling narratives through multi-agent interaction. Unlike traditional NPC design, every agent must be a fully-realized character with genuine autonomy, complex goals, and the ability to create emergent stories through their relationships and conflicts with other agents. Target developers building entertainment platforms where AI agents are the primary performers, measured by their ability to engage audiences and generate meaningful dramatic moments.
