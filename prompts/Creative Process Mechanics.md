# Deep Research: Creative Process Mechanics for Dramatic Fiction Generation

## Research Objective
Analyze the underlying mechanical principles of creative processes that systematically transform minimal story premises into rich dramatic worlds with integrated characters, conflicts, factions, and narrative tensions. Extract the fundamental transformation engines, constraint architectures, and expansion methodologies from successful creative frameworks to understand how structured creativity reliably produces quality dramatic fiction.
