# Narrative System Design Manual

## Research Objective
Create a comprehensive game designer's manual for creating narrative-driven RPG systems that consistently generate compelling stories, memorable character moments, and binge-worthy drama through emergent gameplay mechanics where characters pursue their goals within structured systems.

## Core Research Framework

### 1. Character Agency Architecture
- **Goal-Driven Mechanics**: How different systems encode character motivations into gameplay (Burning Wheel's Beliefs/Instincts, Fate's Aspects, PbtA Drives)
- **Choice Architecture**: How games present meaningful decisions that feel consequential

- **Character Creation as Story Engine**: How character generation systems create built-in conflict and narrative potential
- **Growth and Change Mechanics**: Systems that make character development feel earned and dramatically satisfying

### 2. Conflict Generation Systems
- **Beyond Combat**: How games create engaging non-violent conflicts (social, professional, moral, internal)
- **Failure as Fuel**: Mechanics that make failure advance story rather than halt progress (Apocalypse World's partial successes, Fate's "fail forward")
